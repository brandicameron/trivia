# Trivia!

Built this quick little triva game to get more practice with react & consuming an api â€” but also to try to get in the habit of working in branches and making frequent commits. Going to need more practice there, as I would often get carried away coding and would forget to branch for new features or commit properly. ðŸ˜¬

## Things Learned:

- First time using an html progress bar element, had to look up the webkit & moz to be able to style it properly.
- The trivia questions and answers coming from the api contain html entities, which would show in the jsx â€” found an npm packgage called [he](https://www.npmjs.com/package/he) to decode the text and display it properly.
- Got a chance to mess around with Context again.
- Disabling buttons on condition in jsx.
